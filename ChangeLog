  - Display the percentage of the operation which has been completed when verbose >= 1 (sort of progress bar)
  - Display information about physical disks as well as partitions in "fsarchiver probe <mode>"
  - Fixed bug with archive splitting: the split size was sometimes incorrect due to an integer overflow
  - Added option "--exclude/-e <pattern>" to exclude files/dirs. It works for both archiving and extracting.

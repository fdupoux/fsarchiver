Special thanks to Clive Wagenaar who helped a lot by testing 
fsarchiver-0.3.x and found several important bugs and help in
their resolutions.

Special thanks to Leon Bene who reported a crash and who executed
many tests using debugging version to identify the cause of the
crash. It permitted to fix a critical integer overflow bug with
the "u64 headerlen" when the total size of the attributes is more
than 65535 bytes in the header. It has been fixed in fsarchiver-0.6.4.

Many thanks to Marcos Mello who helped a lot improve the XFS support
in fsarchiver-0.6.20. He found unexpected fsarchiver behaviors with new
versions of the kernel and xfsprogs, did a lot of research regarding these
components, and tested the XFS fixes in fsarchiver. He also provided fixes
and documentation updates in fsarchiver-0.6.24. He also did a lot of
research regarding EXT4 and helped improve the handling of extfs on
very large block devices in fsarchiver-0.8.2.

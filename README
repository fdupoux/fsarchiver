About FSArchiver
----------------
FSArchiver is a system tool that allows you to save the contents of a 
file-system to a compressed archive file. The file-system can be restored 
on a partition which has a different size and it can be restored on a 
different file-system. Unlike tar/dar, FSArchiver also creates the 
file-system when it extracts the data to partitions. Everything is 
checksummed in the archive in order to protect the data. If the archive 
is corrupt, you just loose the current file, not the whole archive. 
Fsarchiver is released under the GPL-v2 license. You should read the 
Quick start guide if you are using FSArchiver for the first time.

Detailed description
--------------------
The purpose of this project is to provide a safe and flexible file-system 
backup/deployment tool. Other open-source file-systems tools such as 
partimage already exist. These tools are working at the filesystem blocks 
level, so it's not possible to restore the backup to a smaller partition, 
and restoring to a bigger partition forces you to resize the filesystem 
by hand.

The purpose is to have a very flexible program. FSArchiver can extract an 
archive to a partition which is smaller that the original one as long as 
there is enough space to store the data. It can also restore the data on 
a different file-system, so it can use it when you want to convert your 
file-system: you can backup an ext3 file-system, and restore it as a 
reiserfs.

FSArchiver is working at the file level. It can make an archive of most 
unix file-system (ext3, reiserfs, xfs, ...) that the running kernel can 
mount with a read-write support. It will preserve all the standard unix 
file attributes (permissions, timestamps, symbolic-links, hard-links, 
extended-attributes, ...), as long as the kernel has support for it 
enabled.

Limitations
-----------
There are several limitations anyway: it does not support the fat filesystem.
FSArchiver won't preserve the features which are very specific to a 
file-system. For instance, if you create a snapshot in a btrfs volume 
(the new-generation file system for linux), FSArchiver won't know anything 
about that, and it will just backup the contents seen when you mount the 
partition.

FSArchiver is safe when it makes backups of partitions which are not mounted 
or mounted read-only. There is an option to force the backup of a read-write 
mounted volume, but there may be problems with the files that changed during 
the backup. If you want to backup partition which are in use, the best thing 
to do is to make an LVM snapshot of the partition using lvcreate -s, which 
is part of the LVM userland tools. Unfortunately you can only make snapshots 
of partitions which are LVM Logical Volumes.

You can have more details about the current status of that project which is 
under active development.

Protection against data loss
----------------------------
FSArchiver is using two levels of checksums to protect your data against 
corruption. Each block of each file has a 32bit checksum written in the 
archive. That way we can identify which block of your file is damaged. Once a 
file has been restored, the md5 checksum of the whole file is compared to the 
original md5. It's a 128bit checksum, so it's will detect all file corruptions.
In case one file is damaged, FSArchiver will restore all the other files from 
your archive, so you won't loose all your data. It's very different from 
tar.gz where the whole tar is compressed with gzip. In that case, the data 
which are written after the corruption are lost. FSArchiver-0.2.3 and newer 
version are able to ignore corrupt contents in an archive file, so all the 
other files will be restored.
